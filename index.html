      <h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
       <h5> 
          I am a driven, and passionate Junior Web Developer with a
          previous art/design background. Recently putting over one thousand hours into development training through Enspiral Dev Academy.</br>
          Currently seeking full time employment
          in a front end development position, though I am equally as comfortable in back end development.</br>


          Enjoy both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. 
          Having the experience to both design and building products really excites me. Technology is the way of the future, my passion is visually creating meaning that 
          interacts and connects emotionally with  people.</br>

          I enjoy being curious and pushing the boundaries of technology and design these have endless possibilities, but I also have an empathetic approach to problems.</br>
          I often use empathy to explore the "why" and solve the "how".</br>
          I admire the continous advances in technology and seeing it create better
          ways to solving problems for the community.</br>

          I am really excited about my technology career and contributing to society as a woman.
          Right now, I am rebuilding a personal website, learning gulp and starting a group app
          project.

        (University of Auckland- ELAM) - 2010 - 2014</h7></br></a>
        <h5>
        This Degree focused on pushing the boundries on a creative an conceptual level. The final honours year students must research and explore a particular topic and present a thesis with a final presentation in any visual form.</br>
        For me, this was an individualised in-depth theoretical exploration of the self, fine arts, philosophy and design. Please see link to portfolio below.</br>
        Out of 80 students Elam purchased one of my artworks for their private collection now displayed in the University of Auckland.

       <h5>
        Enspiral Dev Academy is a pratical bootcamp style web developing course where over one thousand hours
        is spent learning skills in Ruby and Rails, Javascript, Jquery, Agile, HTML5,CSS3, Git, and TDD.</br>
        Engineering Empathy is the key focus area for soft skills and to help integrate workers into a realistic working environment, this is learning how to work in teams in a commercial high pressure enviroment and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.</br>
        The course has a large emphasise on learning through doing. We pair from day one and every week we finish the week with a team project.
        Over the 18 weeks I built basic terminal apps, to full stack with web frame works such as rails.</br>
        The final project was called "Inkling" - A mind map app for creative ideas, this was an exploration project where art meets code.
        I really felt passionate about this project where I really immersed myself in the unknown of  creativity and technology. It was a learning expereince that mentally challenged and pushed me through designing, programming,  team work, and  a final presentation.</br>
        I also disovered a new  found hobbie three.js which I quickly taught myself in this last week of the project.Note: link below works best in Safari.
